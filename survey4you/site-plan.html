    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Has your business ever been stuck wondering what the customers are wanting? It is difficult to find the answer to
      those questions but that is where I come in. My company creates surveys, so that people’s wants are heard. We have
      you type out questions directed at customers and my company takes care of the rest. By this I will take the
      questions, bundle them up into a survey and publish the survey across other websites as ads.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My audience is businesses who produce items for people. As time goes by, things change and people's wants change.
      My surveys will make sure businesses keep up with the times and understand people's wants.</p>

      Here at survey4you, we believe feedback is critical for a successful business. Especially when that business has
      pesky competitors. This is where we step in and bring a plethora of feedback through the click of a button. You
      tell us what questions you want answered, and we publish them all over the web through surveys. Times are changing
      fast and for a leading business to succeed, it takes knowing the consumer’s wants. Along with this, it gets tough
      making sure everyone is happy, especially when it comes to big businesses with thousands employed. With our
      surveys, you get to know exactly what they think about working for the company and if you are keeping up with
      their demands. Now combine keeping up with the employees and consumers, and you are no doubt going to be on top of
      the competitors.

    <h3>[Page 2] (Survey guide)</h3>
    <p>
      There are many things when it comes to survey questions and creating the questions without a few guidelines will
      cause issues. That is why here at survey4you we offer a set of rules to help guide you with what to ask.
      Tips for surveying customers
      • Have a main question that you want answered
      o It may seem smart to have a lot of different topics asked in one survey, but surveys that do so are rarely
      finished. Be specific in exactly what type of survey you are wanting and make a goal. If you are wanting to know
      why you are losing customers, then it would be best to make a churn survey.
      • Remember to be unbiased and precise
      o Surveys with questions that are long, complex, or vague will cause many issues when it comes to getting
      feedback. So, it is recommended that the questions are simple and written in easily understood vocabulary.
      o Be sure to use neutral language that doesn’t side with anything as that can make the respondents answer in
      accurate and something they don’t agree with.
      o Being precise is critical as it makes the questions smaller and helps with coherency of the questions.
      Tips for surveying employees
      • Keep the survey anonymous.
      o You will get much more honesty and participation if the employees know they won’t be traced back to what they
      are answering.
      • Don’t have too long of a survey
      o It is a good idea to keep the survey as short as possible. Not only will you have less participation, but also
      more automatic answers that aren’t going to be good for improving the company’s overall successfulness.
