                        <p>We will directly link a phone number or email to receive all the feedback from the consumers. The
                            moment someone submits a completed survey, you or an employee will receive those answers to
                            review. Along with this, there will be a file set up that combines all submitted data to show
                            the overall rating of every opinion in stars.</p>

                            plan, specified survey questions and the preferred method to receiving the completed surveys.
                            With this information, you will be receiving your feedback in no more than a couple days after
                            published. </p>

                        <p>Our first plan is the basic plan which post the surveys on websites through ads.
                            Second plan is the combo package which post the surveys on websites as ads and also sends them out as emails.
                            Third plan is the deluxe package which post the surveys on websites as ads, emails them to people and will text them to
                            people. Prices are negotiable

                            that is ok. However, it can be difficult to know what questions to ask and how to make a
                            successful survey. Therefore, we offer a complete guide on how to ask the questions whether it
                            be a survey for customers or employees. </p>
