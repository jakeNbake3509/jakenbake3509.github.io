                    guidelines will cause issues. That is why here at Survey4you we offer a set of rules to help guide you
                    with what to ask.</p>

                                <li type="circle">It may seem smart to have a lot of different topics asked in one survey, but surveys
                                    that do so are rarely finished. Be specific in exactly what type of survey you are
                                    wanting and make a goal. If you are wanting to know why you are losing customers, then
                                    it would be best to make a churn survey.</li>

                                <li type="circle">Surveys with questions that are long, complex, or vague will cause many issues when it
                                    comes to getting feedback. So, it is recommended that the questions are simple and
                                    written in easily understood vocabulary.</li>
                                <li type="circle">Be sure to use neutral language that doesnâ€™t side with anything as that can make the
                                    respondents answer in accurate and something they don't agree with.</li>
                                <li type="circle">Being precise is critical as it makes the questions smaller and helps with coherency of
                                    the questions.</li>

                                <li type="circle">You will get much more honesty and participation if the employees know they won't be
                                    traced back to what they are answering.</li>
                            <li><h4 class="pointtwo">Don't have too long of a survey</h4></li>
                                <li type="circle">It is a good idea to keep the survey as short as possible. Not only
                                    will you have less participation, but also more automatic answers that aren't going to be
                                    good for improving the company's overall successfulness. </li>
